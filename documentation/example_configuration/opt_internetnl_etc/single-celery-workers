# Extra command-line arguments to the worker
# Note that using gevent is not an option here, as it sends TimeLimitExceeded exceptions which are not catchable,
#  see: https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/userguide/workers.html#time-limits
# Even more: The documentation states that time limit support only exists for prefork and gevent. It does not
#  mention eventlet. So eventlet _might_ work, prefork _will_ work. Eventlet is more efficient, so that's the go to.
# We've seen hangs in the past with sync communication to unbound, this occurs in any pooling option. Setting unbound
# communication to async is now the preferred option. Even though it conflicts with issue #495.
# The -P option is documented here:
#  https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/reference/cli.html#cmdoption-celery-worker-P
# Note that a larger amount of workers will result in too many open files. To have a fixed number of open files,
# Prefork has been chosen. This seems just as fast. Otherwise we have to adjust the max number of open files, which
# feels a bit scary to do right in a structural way
# Eventlet _still_ keeps files open. The open file limit needs to be raised and perhaps to get rid of this symptom the
# workers restarted every night or so.
