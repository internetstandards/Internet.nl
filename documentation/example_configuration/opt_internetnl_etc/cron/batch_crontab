# Workers need to be restarted because of the redis connection leak, see

# Batch scans come in huge numbers, so there is a need for more frequent restarts. Given tasks are acked late, and the
# workers are stopped gracefully no tasks are losts doing this. Suppose we'll want to do 10.000 scans an hour, we'll
# have to reset every 30 minutes or so.
# However, in Jan 2023 we discovered that in production we only did this every 6 hours,
# still exceeding the connection limit. The restart every 6 hrs was reflected here,
# along with a new script that restarts based on number of Redis connections.
