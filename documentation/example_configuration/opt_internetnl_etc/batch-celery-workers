# Using the most horrid and convoluted syntax invented, this is the meaning of belows atrocity:
# worker 20
#   -> starts 20 workers. Now this will be configured to do what we please:
# --concurrency:1,2,3,4 10 (can also be written as -c:1-4)
#   -> tells that workers 1 to 4 have a concurrency of 10
# --concurrency:5-20 1
#   -> tells workers 5-to to have a concurrency of 1
# --queues:1 db_worker
#   -> tells worker one to listen to the db_worker queue only
# The last worker mentioned is for 'the rest'
# Let's start by telling all workers are on concurrency 2
# -c is used for --concurrency, -Q is used for Queues (the longhand is not allowed)
# All queues: db_worker, slow_db_worker, batch_callback, batch_main, worker_slow, batch_slow
# Warning: 50 workers CAN overload your system. 4GB will not cut it in that case!
