    # Introduction
    Welcome to the batch API documentation, a JSON based REST-like API for
    batch testing multiple domains for compliance with modern internet
    standards.

    For a visual representation of this specification you can use
    [https://redocly.github.io/redoc/](https://redocly.github.io/redoc/?url=@@DESC_INTRO_REDOCLY_LINK@@).

    @@DESC_INTRO_EXTRA@@

    ## Versioning
    The API uses semantic versioning (`major.minor.patch`).

    Changes to the `.major` version introduce and/or remove
    semantics/paths/features to the API and that could lead to breaking changes.

    Changes to the `.minor` version introduce new fields that don't break the
    current API but you would need extra parsing code to get the new values.

    Changes to the `.patch` version denote changes to the text of this document
    but not to the API functionality eg. typos.

    The `.major` version is part of the API path. In case the user requests a
    path with a previous version, a message to check the version number will be
    returned as the result to the API call.

    This API only supports the current version.

    # Authentication
    All batch API endpoints are protected by HTTP Basic Authentication.
    To use the endpoints the client must supply an HTTP Basic Authentication
    header of the form:
    ```
    Authorization: Basic(base64)
    ```
    where `base64` is the base64-encoding of the string `<username>:<password>`.

        Registers a new batch request for the given domains. You can use the
        returned id in a status request to track progress.

        _A note on the domain list_: After the initial validation of the
        domains' name, domains are used as-is. No extra logic is used to
        produce more test targets e.g, web testing the bare and the www
        version of a domain requires both domain names to be present in the
        domain list.
