# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the lastest release will be actively supported. In case of serious regressions or security issues, we may decide to backport a fix to older versions. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy is located at [https://en.internet.nl/disclosure/](https://en.internet.nl/disclosure/). Alternatively, you can [report the issue through GitHub](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/security/advisories/new)
