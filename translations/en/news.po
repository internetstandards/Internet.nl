"## Spoofing prevention\n"
"Spoofing of email is a common attack vector where an attacker sends an email from someone else's mail address. This technique is for example often used to phish for passwords or other valuable information. This can be prevented with authenticity marks based on the standards DMARC, DKIM and SPF. It is important to set a sufficiently strict policy when using these, i.e. `p=quarantine` or `p=reject` for DMARC and `~all` or `-all` for SPF. This was already tested by Internet.nl but as of today these will weigh in the score, as was already announced in the beginning of this year.\n"
"\n"
"## Secure mail server connections\n"
"E-mail in transit that is not encrypted, can be eavesdropped by attackers. The STARTTLS standard prevents passive attackers from reading emails in transit. In addition DANE protects against active attackers stripping STARTTLS encryption by manipulating the mail traffic. Internet.nl already checked for these standards. In this new version of Internet.nl this test is conformant with the [factsheet \"Secure the connections of mail servers\"](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/factsheets/2019/juni/01/factsheet-secure-the-connections-of-mail-servers) from the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Furthermore the test results now weigh in the score.\n"

"The basis for this collaboration is a number of open standards and practices\n"
"that all the network operators have adopted voluntarily. In fact, voluntary\n"

"## Joining the ecosystem\n"
"\n"
"When you connect to the Internet, you become a part of its ecosystem. Even\n"
"more, across the Internet there is no clear line between consumers and\n"
"suppliers; every participant is a contributor. That comes with a collaborative\n"
"responsibility: you should consider not only how the global system impacts\n"
"you, but also the impact you produce on the system through your activity or\n"
"inactivity.\n"
"\n"
"This perspective is especially important in the area of security (also see the\n"
"[Internet Society&#39;s recent paper on Collaborative Security](https://www.internetsociety.org/collaborativesecurity)).\n"
"As an end-user, that means that you do all you can to keep your own systems\n"
"secure, to reduce the risk of their be taken over and used to abuse others.\n"
"For service providers, that means making specific security features available.\n"
"Those offerings and measures may not bring an immediate return on the\n"
"investment, and in the short term they may even lead to additional cost. But\n"
"they will help to raise the level of security in the system and reinforce\n"
"confidence in the Internet.\n"
"\n"
"And therein lays the problem: there is no direct economic incentive for\n"
"individual providers to deploy some of these technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Can&#39;t their deployment be mandated then? In theory yes, but that approach\n"
"would go against one the fundamental and foundational principles of the\n"
"Internet: as an organic system, a network of autonomous networks, not built\n"
"from a global blueprint but developing in accordance with local needs and\n"
"conditions, deployment depends on voluntary agreement and collaboration.\n"
"Forcing security and scalability through global mandates may be slow, and may\n"
"have unintended side effects. It also assumes that a global consensus can be\n"
"reached on a multitude of security issues.\n"
"\n"
"The voluntary collaborative approach, combined with a continuing dialogue with\n"
"those who impact and are impacted by certain measures &mdash; the end-users,\n"
"the policy makers, and the technicians &mdash; allows more flexibility and\n"
"agility. Measures taken can more easily be adjusted to minimise unintended\n"
"adverse consequences.\n"
"\n"
"## &quot;The Internet way&quot;\n"
"\n"
"Accomplishing global deployment of secure, resilient, future-proof internet\n"
"technology is better done &quot;the Internet way&quot;: at the initiative of\n"
"individual actors, based on their own decisions and their own leadership; and\n"
"through sharing know-how and experience, both voluntary and professionally.\n"
"\n"
"One important aspect in getting new innovations deployed is awareness and\n"
"visibility. Deploying these internet technologies is like installing new\n"
"plumbing: something has improved, but the water still tastes the same. Leaders\n"
"who want to inspire their colleagues to follow suit will have to provide some\n"
"visibility into what their innovations brings.\n"
"\n"
"A profound example is the Internet.nl initiative (to be launched soon), in\n"
"which the Dutch Internet community, a ministry, and a governmental agency have\n"
"collaborated to set up a website that helps to highlight the status of\n"
"deployment of key internet technology. The website gives users simple and\n"
"straightforward information about their own access to various innovative\n"
"technologies.\n"
"\n"
"Some of these technologies contribute to the continued scalability of the\n"
"Internet (IPv6 support and transparency of the network), while some relate to\n"
"security (DNSSEC, anti-spam and anti-phishing, and support for encryption). By\n"
"doing so, the site helps to promote the open standards that will make the\n"
"Internet more scalable and more secure. It highlights the leaders, and\n"
"provides the followers with tools and know-how."

"## Policy checking for DMARC and SPF\n"

"## Checking validity period for HSTS\n"
"Internet.nl now also checks for the validity period of the HSTS policy. We consider a HSTS cache validity period of at least six months to be sufficiently secure. A long period is beneficial because it also protects infrequent visitors. However if you want to stop supporting HTTPS, you will have to wait longer until the validity of the HSTS policy in all browsers that vistited your website, has expired.\n"

"## Generic\n"
"* The ability to choose a different language from a dropdown menu. Visitors will get the equivalent page in the selected language (if available).\n"
"* The requirement that all name servers must be available over IPv6 has been cancelled. It is sufficient if at least as many name servers are available over IPv6 as there are over IPv4. This applies to both the webite test and the mail test.\n"
"\n"
"## Connection test\n"
"* The detection of the internet provider is more precise and timeouts occur less frequent.\n"
"\n"
"## Website test\n"
"* The test checks whether a HSTS-policy is available. Through HSTS a web browser will 'know' after the first visit that a website can only be accessed through a secure connection (HTTPS, not HTTP). This can prevent so-called man-in-the-middle attacks, e.g. when using public Wi-Fi. In case of deviations, the message is no longer 'orange' but 'red'.\n"
"* The test now checks whether the website enforces HTTPS by using a server redirect (301 or 302) or by applying only HTTPS (and no HTTP). In case of deviations, the message is no longer 'orange' but 'red'.\n"
"* In the case of some websites, the TLS results incorrectly showed that 'client-initiated renegotiation' was allowed. This has been solved.\n"
"* In the test results of websites with a redirect from IPv6/IPv4 to IPv4-only, the HSTS-policy over IPv6 remained incorrectly undetected. This has been solved.\n"
"* The test now checks whether actual HTTP traffic is sent over port 443. If that is not the case, the test will no longer draw incorrect conclusions which are HTTPS-related .\n"
"\n"
"## Mail test\n"
"* If Internet.nl cannot establish a connection to a mail server (e.g. by 'rate limiting'), visitors will now be asked to try again later.\n"
"* Thanks to the improved adjustment of timeouts, failure of the test part 'STARTTLS' is less likely. Therefore certain mail servers can now be tested without problems.\n"
"* Running connections serially and minimizing the number of connections should help to reduce the risk of 'rate limiting' of mail servers. Therefore certain mail servers can now be tested which was not possible before.\n"

"The test tool [Internet.nl](https://internet.nl) checks TLS configurations for websites under the test category 'HTTPS' and for mail servers under the test category 'STARTTLS and DANE'. The latest 'IT guidelines for TLS' from NCSC-NL are used as a baseline. If a 'good' or 'sufficient' setting is found, then Internet.nl will show a green check ('passed'). In case of a 'phase out' setting, like TLS 1.0 and 1.1, you will see an orange exclamation mark ('warning'), and an 'insufficient' configuration gets a red cross ('fail').\n"
"\n"
"## ICT guidelines for TLS\n"
"In April 2019 NCSC-NL published the ['IT Security Guidelines for Transport Layer Security (TLS) v2.0'](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-tls). The advised settings are future proof; as expected TLS connections which are secured according to the new guidelines will not require any modifications in the near future. At the same time the guidelines also ensure that systems remain interoperable and prevent TLS settings to be incompatible.\n"
"\n"
"## 'Phase out' TLS settings\n"
"'Phase out' settings are known to be fragile and are at risk of becoming insufficiently secure. Take the following into consideration when making a decision regarding these 'phase out' settings.\n"
"\n"
"Browser makers have announced that they will stop supporting TLS 1.1 and 1.0 by Q1 2020. This will impact the reachability of websites that do not offer support for TLS 1.2 and/or 1.3.\n"
"\n"
"Quite some mail servers only support older TLS versions. If the sending and receiving mail server both do not support the same TLS version, they will usually fall back to unencrypted mail transport. Because of that it could be advisable to keep supporting TLS versions with a 'phase out' status for a while. Make an informed decision based on log data on when to disable these 'phase out' TLS versions.\n"

"## Latest TLS guidelines from NCSC-NL supported\n"
"The recently updated [IT security guidelines for Transport Layer Security (TLS)](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2021/january/19/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-2.1) from NCSC-NL have led to the following changes in the website and mail test:\n"
"\n"
"1. The security level of TLS 1.2 is downgraded from *Good* to *Sufficient* (guideline B1-1). TLS 1.3 is still *Good*. This has no impact on the Internet.nl test result, because we already considered *Sufficient* TLS versions to be enough to succeed for the subtest. However, we have included the downgrade in the test explanation of the TLS version subtest. \n"
"2. The requirements for the ordering of algorithm selections have been simplified. Only the security level now determines the prescribed ordering (guideline B2-5). We have adjusted the cipher order subtest of Internet.nl accordingly.\n"
"3. Supporting client-initiated renegotation is no longer *Insufficient*, but *Sufficient* (guideline B8-1). Internet.nl changed the requirement level for the client-initiated renegotation subtest into 'Optional'. \n"
"\n"
"## CSP settings evaluated\n"
"Content-Security-Policy ([CSP](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/)) guards a website against content injection attacks including cross-site scripting (XSS). We now check for several (in)secure CSP settings (like `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`), although we do not exhaustively test the effectiveness of your CSP configuration. The [requirement level](/faqs/report/) of the CSP subtest has been raised from 'Optional' to 'Recommended'.\n"
"\n"
"## Non-mail domains better supported\n"
"We now explicitly check for non-sending and non-receiving mail configurations, and expect the following.\n"
"\n"
"* Non-sending domain: Use the most strict DMARC policy (`p=reject`) and SPF policy (`-all`) for your domain that you do not use for sending mail in order to prevent abuse ('spoofing'). Note that DKIM is not necessary in this case.\n"
"* Non-receiving domain: In case you do not want to receive mail on your domain that has A/AAAA records, we advise you to use [Null MX](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7505). In case your domain does *not* have A/AAAA records and you do not want to receive mail on it, we advise you to configure no MX record at all (i.e. even *not* an Null MX record). \n"
"\n"
"## Minimum max-age for HSTS extended\n"
"HTTP Strict Transport Security ([HSTS](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6797)) forces a web browser to connect directly via HTTPS when revisiting your website. This helps preventing man-in-the-middle attacks. We have decided to extend the mimimum HSTS cache validity period from 6 months to 1 year (`max-age=31536000`). This is in conformance with the common good practice. \n"
"\n"
"Further details on the above improvements can be found in the test explanations of the relevant subtests of the [website test](/test-site/) and the [email test](/test-mail/). \n"

"## About Internet.nl\n"

"On April 23rd the NCSC published new [IT Security Guidelines for TLS](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/it-security-guidelines-for-transport-layer-security-tls) (version 2.0). The Dutch Internet Standards Platform was happy to provide feedback during the reviewing phase of the document. The next major release of Internet.nl will use the new TLS guidelines to check TLS connections. Internet.nl currently uses the previous version of the IT Security Guidelines for TLS (version 1.0 from 2014) for checking whether TLS settings are at least “Sufficient”.\n"
"\n"
"When using the new TLS guidelines organizations can achieve secure TLS connections for their internet connections. The advised settings are future proof; as expected TLS connections which are secured according to the new guidelines will not require any modifications in the near future. At the same time the guidelines also ensure that systems remain interoperable and prevent TLS settings to be incompatible.\n"
"\n"
"TLS is an open standard and forms the basis for other standards like HTTPS (secure website connections) and STARTTLS (secure mail server connections). The new TLS guidelines include TLS version 1.3 which was added to the [‘comply-or-explain’ list](https://www.forumstandaardisatie.nl/open-standaarden/lijst/verplicht?f%5B0%5D=field_standard_domain%3A4) of the Dutch Standardisation Forum at the end of 2018. Besides the addition of TLS 1.3, the new TLS guidelines contain some other changes like the new security level “Phase out” for TLS versions 1.0 and 1.1. The Dutch Data Protection Authority [stated](https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl/nieuws/nieuwe-ict-beveiligingsrichtlijnen-voor-transport-layer-security-tls) that organizations which are still using ‘phased out’ TLS configuration settings, need to replace them in the near future since these settings might not meet the security requirements resulting from the GDPR.

"Below we describe the major changes.\n"
"\n"
"* The previous version of Internet.nl did test the **security of the HTTPS configuration over either IPv6 or IPv4**. Through manual testing we regularly see websites that have unintended different HTTPS configurations over IPv6 and IPv4. Therefore in the new release the HTTPS configuration is tested over both IPv6 and IPv4. **From now on** the result of this test item is part of the overall score in the website test.\n"
"* The website tests checks whether a **HSTS policy** is published. Through HSTS a web browser gets informed after the first usage that a website only may be visited over HTTPS. This can prevent so-called man-in-the-middle attacks (for example when a public Wi-Fi hotspot is used). The result of this test item is displayed as an orange warning in case the HSTS policy is absent. As of **July 2016** the result will be part of the score in the website test.\n"
"* The website test does test whether **HTTPS is enforced** for a website. There are two ways to enforce HTTPS that are described below.The result of this test item is displayed as an orange warning in case the HSTS policy is absent. As of **July 2016** the result will be part of the score in the website test.\n"
"   1. By redirecting HTTP to HTTPS. This can be done by redirecting `http://example.nl` to `https://example.nl`. It is important that both domain names are identical because a web browser does only accept a HSTS policy for a certain domain when a HTTPS connection is used. If `http://example.nl` redirects to `https://www.example.nl` then a HSTS policy normally will not be used by the browser, unless a user explicitly enters `https://example.nl` or clicks on a hyperlink with this URL.\n"
"   2. By only supporting HTTPS and no HTTP. Because a browser normally uses a HTTP-connection after a user enters a domain name, users should enter `https://example.nl` to reach the website or click on a hyperlink with this URL.\n"
"* The website test does check whether **HTTP compression** is used. Enabling HTTP compression does make many websites vulnerable for BREACH when no other mitigating measures are in place. Switching off HTTP compression could negatively impact performance. In case HTTP compression is detected an **orange warning** is displayed.\n"
"* The website test of the previous version of Internet.nl already checked whether the **content of a website was similar over IPv6 and IPv4**. The test took into account legitimate differences for example caused by different add banners. The result of this test item **from now on** is part of the overall score in the website test. \n"
"* If a user does enter a **non-existing domain name** a red error message is displayed.\n"

"## Route leaks and hijacks  \n"
"Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) is a technique that aims to prevent certain route leaks and hijacks. This concerns cases where Internet traffic is redirected to the systems of an unauthorized network. Such a detour may be the result of a simple typing error by a network administrator who thereby unintentionally diverts Internet traffic, or it may be the result of a targeted attack on the infrastructure of the Internet, for example, to make websites unreachable or to steal data from Internet users. A relevant Dutch example concerns an incident where a set of IP addresses belonging to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was [temporarily hijacked](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/ah-tk-20142015-3181.html) by a Bulgarian network operator in 2014. \n"
"\n"
"## Operation of RPKI\n"
"RPKI allows the legitimate holder of a block of IP addresses to publish a digitally signed statement regarding the intentions of routing from its network. These statements, called Route Origin Authorizations (ROAs), can be cryptographically validated by other network administrators and then used to set up filters. This allows routers to filter out routes that violate the ROAs published for the IP addresses in question (invalid = reject).\n"
"\n"
"RPKI thus requires action from two parties. First, the holder of the IP addresses must publish ROAs. Second, the party receiving routes from other networks via Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) must filter based on all globally published ROAs, where invalid routes should never be accepted or advertised. \n"
"\n"
"## RPKI Test in Internet.nl\n"
"The new RPKI test is part of the [website test](/test-site/) and of the [email test](/test-mail/). All IP addresses found for the web server, mail servers and name servers of a domain are evaluated. \n"
"\n"
"First, the test checks whether at least one ROA has been published for each IP address. Then, it verifies whether the route announcement of each IP address is matched by any ROA found. For now, the results of the RPKI test do not weigh into the overall test result score — they will in early 2023. Later this year, the RPKI test will also be added to the API and dashboard of Internet.nl.\n"
"\n"
"Special thanks go to NCSC-NL for developing a large part of the new RPKI test and, in accordance with prevailing [Dutch government policy](https://zoek.officielebekendmakingen.nl/kst-26643-676.html) (\"open, unless\"), making it available as open source. The foundation of the new RPKI test is formed by [Routinator](https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/rpki/routinator/), open source RPKI Relying Party software developed by NLnet Labs.\n"
"\n"
"## Additional measures\n"
"In addition to RPKI, there are other, complementary techniques that make Internet routing more secure. The [MANRS](https://www.manrs.org/) initiative provides an overview of best practices that we recommend to implement as well.\n"

"## What is your contact point for security vulnerabilities?\n"
"At any time, security researchers (also known as benevolent or ethical hackers) may find digital vulnerabilities in your website or IT systems. Of course, you want to be informed as fast as possible when such a discovery is made, so you can respond quickly and fix the leak. Unfortunately, it is often unclear where a security researcher can report a found vulnerability. This means valuable time may be lost in finding and reaching the right department or person within an organisation. The well-intentioned message may not even reach anyone at all.\n"
"\n"
"## Faster warnings with security.txt \n"
"Since malicious parties can also detect these vulnerabilities, no avoidable time should be lost in alerting affected organisations. The [Digital Trust Center](https://www.digitaltrustcenter.nl) (DTC) regularly experiences that this speed is important when alerting Dutch companies. Security.txt can help. By making contact information available through security.txt as an organisation, security researchers can immediately alert the right person or department. The DTC therefore recommends that every company publishes a security.txt file and keeps it up to date. \n"
"\n"
"## Internet.nl test on security.txt \n"
"The new test for security.txt in Internet.nl is intended as a tool for companies and other organisations. The test checks whether the security.txt file is present on the domain name and whether the information included has the correct format. \n"
"\n"
"Gerben Klein Baltink, chair Internet Standards Platform: \n"
"\n"
">\"Together with the DTC, we worked to ensure that Internet.nl now also tests for security.txt. By simply adding this standardised format to your web domain, it has become easier for \"helping hackers\" to find the right contacts if they find a vulnerability with you. I therefore warmly encourage organisations to publish a security.txt file and check via Internet.nl whether this has been done correctly. This is how we keep the Internet open, free and secure together!\"\n"
"\n"
"For now, the security.txt standard within Internet.nl has the recommended status. The results of the security.txt test do not yet weigh into the overall test result score. Later this year, the security.txt test will also be added to Internet.nl's API and dashboard. [The Netherlands Standardisation Forum](https://forumstandaardisatie.nl/netherlands-standardisation-forum) is currently reviewing whether the security.txt standard is suitable to become mandatory for the government via inclusion on the 'comply or explain' list.\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"## Want to know more? \n"
"Does your company or organisation already have a security.txt file? Enter your website URL at [Internet.nl](https://internet.nl) and you'll know within seconds. \n"
"Wondering how to easily create your own security.txt file? Then read more about [security.txt on the DTC website](https://www.digitaltrustcenter.nl/securitytxt) (in Dutch). \n"
"\n"
"## About Internet.nl\n"

"## X-XSS-Protection test removed\n"
"We decided to remove the test for X-XSS-Protection. Most browsers have [deprecated support for X-XSS-Protection](https://caniuse.com/#feat=mdn-http_headers_x-xss-protection) making it of very limited security value in practice. Furthermore browser implementations can be vulnerable for [cross-site leak attacks](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/xss-auditor). We advise website owners to use Content-Security-Policy (CSP) without allowing unsafe-inline scripts instead of X-XSS-Protection.\n"
"\n"
"## No MX configured\n"
"When no mail server (MX) is configured or when we detect a Null MX record certain tests are not applicable. From now on Internet.nl shows blue informational icons (instead of orange warnings) for these test results and provides  more suitable verdict texts. Like before there is no score impact. So it is fine to have no MX configured, as long as you are aware and you still have the relevant standards (like DMARC) in place. \n"
"\n"
"We advise to use \"Null MX\" (RFC 7505) for a domain without mail servers. In that way a domain clearly announces that it accepts no email. Note that the test does not fall back to A/AAAA records for mail servers in case of absence of an MX record. \n"
