"# About Internet.nl\n"
"\n"
"## What is Internet.nl?\n"
"Internet.nl helps you to check whether your internet is up to date. Do your [website](/test-site/), [email](/test-mail/) and [internet connection](/test-connection/) use **modern and reliable Internet Standards**? And if they don't, what can you do about it?\n"
"\n"
"## What are Internet Standards?\n"
"In order to exchange data between computers around the world, we need international agreements on how computers talk to one another. The digital \"plugs and sockets\" that link everything together, so to speak. These agreements are called Internet Standards or internet protocols. An example is SMTP, a well-known protocol for sending email. This technical core of the internet is unvisible and unknown to most users. However it is crucial for a working internet today and in the future.\n"
"\n"
"## Why is it important to be up to date?\n"
"The original internet standards date from the 70s and 80s, when the number of internet users was small. Nowadays, there are more than three billion users worldwide! And these people use the internet more and more for transactions that are privacy-sensitive and costly. The old standards cannot meet this scale nor the modern safety requirements. For instance, criminals are abusing the SMTP standard to spoof the sender address of an email. This means that we have to start using new, smarter standards that keep our internet reliable. The good news is that these modern Internet Standards are available.\n"
"\n"
"## Are the Netherlands taking the lead in using modern Internet Standards?\n"
"Unfortunately, that is not the case. Even in a modern country like the Netherlands (that became the first internet connected European country in 1988) we use too many outdated standards that fall short of reliability. Not using these modern standards is a risk for the individual internet user, but also for the Dutch economy and for the world at large. Therefore, please help improving the internet and make sure that you use modern Internet Standards.\n"
"\n"
"## Who should act on modern Internet Standards?\n"
"Our access, hosting and email providers should take care of implementing modern internet standards and setting them correctly. Do the test results show any shortcomings? Then please send a message about this to your provider(s). If you use your own connection, webserver or mailserver, you have to take care of the correct settings yourself.\n"
"\n"
"## Why don’t you address the access, hosting and email providers directly?\n"
"We do. Still it is important that internet users are aware themselves and send out signals to their provider(s) as well. This may come as a surprise, but in a modern country like the Netherlands we still use many standards that are outdated and lack reliability. Therefore please help us to improve the internet together, and demand modern Internet Standards.\n"

[...] We find evidence that 178,439 out of 8,860,639(2.01%) publicly accessible DNS servers provided invalid IPs or MX records for one or more of these domains.\n"

"### What norm is Internet.nl using?\n"
"Internet.nl checks the (correct) implementation of modern Internet Standards that improve the reliability of online services. A score of 100% means that a website, e-mail service or internet connection complies with our test norm. This norm is based on the Internet Standards on the 'comply-or-explain' list of the Dutch Standardisation Forum, on the security advices of the Dutch NCSC and on the relevant RFC's of IETF. \n"
"\n"
"### Will the norm be adjusted?\n"
"The test norm of Internet.nl will be adjusted over time as the state of the art changes. Adjustments will be announced through news items on our website. New subtests will (usually) not impact the score after their initial release and have the 'RECOMMENDED' or 'OPTIONAL' status. In the future these new items could get the 'REQUIRED' status and weigh in the overall score.\n"
"\n"
"### How does the score relate to security?\n"
"Although many of the tested Intern Standards contribute to a higher security level of your website, mail service or internet connection, a 100% score does not mean that an online service is fully secure. There are more aspects which are important for the security of your online services. But these are out of scope for Internet.nl. Please keep in mind that Internet.nl is intended as a standards compliance test and not as a security test. \n"
"\n"
"### How is the test report structured?\n"
"- Internet.nl contains **three main tests**, i.e. for websites, mail services and internet connections. \n"
"- These main tests consist of **test categories** that include **subtests**. For example, one of the main tests is the website test which contains a test category on HTTPS that has a subtest on HSTS.\n"
"- A subtest can have one of the following three requirement levels (in conformance with [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)):\n"
"  - REQUIRED ('must')\n"
"  - RECOMMENDED ('should')\n"
"  - OPTIONAL ('may')\n"
"- When a subtest is either 'RECOMMENDED' or 'OPTIONAL', this is mentioned in the test explanation.\n"
"\n"
"### How is the percentage score calculated?\n"
"- Each main test is resulting in an overall percentage score.\n"
"- Every test category of a main test weighs more or less evenly in the overall percentage score. So if a main test consists of four test categories, the maximum score for every test category is 25%.\n"
"- Only the subtests with the status 'REQUIRED' weigh in the score of a test category and in the overall percentage score.\n"
"- Websites with a perfect score of 100% will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/)."

"# Privacy statement\n"
"\n"
"*Revised 16th of July 2018*\n"
"\n"
"The Dutch Internet Standards Platform respects your privacy. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about what personal data we collect when you use our website and other services on Internet.nl and how we process this data. Your rights are covered by the applicable laws, mainly the [European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) and the [Dutch Telecommunications Act](http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0009950/).\n"
"\n"
"## What data will be collected?\n"
"\n"
"### Website (Internet.nl)\n"
"\n"
"#### Application\n"
"When you are using Internet.nl we collect the following data which is necessary for the functioning of the website.\n"
"\n"
"- IP address of your client (remote host) which made the request to our web server:\n"
"\n"
"\t- When a connection test is performed, only your *anonymized* IP address and *anonymized* reverse name are stored in the application database and shown in the connection test report that is available for the user via a permalink.\n"
"- In any other cases your (full or anonymized) IP address is *not* stored in the application database.\n"
"\n"
"- Domain names that you provided to perform email or website tests:\n"
"\n"
" \t- Domain names are stored in the application database. They will be shown in the test reports available for the user via a permalink and could be shown in the Hall of Fame.\n"
"\t- Only the domain name is stored, but *not* the 'local-part' (i.e. the part before @example.nl) of a provided email address.\n"
"\n"
"#### Server logs\n"
" For debugging connection issues and for solving (security) incidents we keep the below data in our web server logs. \n"
"\n"
"- IP address of the client (remote host) which made the request to our web server;\n"
"- The time that the request was received;\n"
"- User-Agent HTTP request header that the client browser reported about itself;\n"
"- Status code that the server sends back to the client;\n"
"- Size of the object returned to the client;\n"
"- Error message with regard to processing the request.\n"
"\n"
"#### User analytics\n"
"We put analytical cookies on your device to analyze the use of our website. We run Matomo (formerly Piwik) on our own web server. Matomo is one of the most privacy-friendly analytical tools currently available. The statistics generated with these cookies are used only to improve our website. \n"
"\n"
"We collect the following data via cookies:\n"
"\n"
"- IP address (anonymized);\n"
"- Very rough location of the user based on anonymized IP address; \n"
"- Date and time;\n"
"- Title of the page being viewed;\n"
"- URL of the page being viewed;\n"
"- URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page;\n"
"- Screen resolution;\n"
"- Time in local timezone;\n"
"- Files that were clicked and downloaded;\n"
"- Link clicks to an outside domain;\n"
"- Pages generation time;\n"
"- Main Language of the browser;\n"
"- User Agent of the browser.\n"
"\n"
"Because the impact of these analytical cookies on your privacy is very limited in light of the GDPR and Section 11.7a of the Dutch Telecommunication Act, you do not need to give your consent for this. If you do not want us to place cookies on your device, we recommend that you turn on the *Do Not Track* function in your browser. Matomo will not follow you and will not place cookies. For more information about Do Not Track and how to turn it on in your browser, see the website [All About Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/).\n"
"\n"
"### Email (@internet.nl)\n"
"When you send email-mails to [question@internet.nl](mailto:question@internet.nl) we collect the following data: \n"
"\n"
"- Email address used and other mail header data (like time);\n"
"- Any other personal data that the sender put in the mail.\n"
"\n"
"## What measures are in place to secure the collected data?\n"
"\n"
"### Access and third parties\n"
"Our services are running on our servers, that are maintained by Open Netlabs / NLnet Labs. ECP is in charge of operating the mailbox. Collected data may be shared with other [members of the Internet Standards Platform](/about/) only to answer questions, to solve issues or to improve our services. \n"
"\n"
"No third party services are used (like external analytics tooling or web fonts). We do not in any way pass on personal data collected by us to third parties (i.e. outside the Internet Standards Platform), unless we are legally obliged to do so (for example, if the authorities with a legal basis request data from us). \n"
"\n"
"### Technical measures\n"
"We have implemented a.o. the following technical measures to secure your personal data:\n"
"\n"
"- Modern, secure standards are in place. We comply with our own tests. E.g. our web server offers an encrypted connection (HTTPS) and the domain is signed (DNSSEC);\n"
"- Software on our servers is updated regularly;\n"
"- Our engineers use strong authentication to access the servers.\n"
"\n"
"In case you find a vulnerability, despite of our efforts, please act in accordance with our [responsible disclosure](/disclosure/) policy.\n"
"\n"
"### Anonymization\n"
"- Application: The anonymization of the IP address of your client means that at least the last 16 bits of each IPv4 address and the last 96 bits of each IPv6 address are discarded and replaced with zero's before storing in the application database (e.g. visible is only 198.51.0.0 or 2001:db8::). Besides we anonymize the found reverse name by masking the first one or more labels. By anonymizing the IP address and reverse name we make sure that it is not possible to relate these directly to a person anymore, even not with the other associated data colllected. \n"
"IP addresses belonging to web servers, mail servers or name servers will not be anonymized, because we consider this data to be public data which is published in DNS. The same goes for domain names; we also consider this to be public data. \n"
"- User analytics: At least 16 bits for IPv4 and 80 bits for IPv6 are discarded and replaced with zero's before storing an IP address in our analytics tooling (e.g. visible is only 198.51.0.0 or 2001:db81:85a3::).\n"
"\n"
"### Data retention period\n"
"- Application: Because the anonymized visiting IP address and associated collected data can not be directly related to a person, we do not maintain a specific retention period for the data stored in our aplication database.\n"
"- Server logs: Data collected in our server logs will be deleted after three calendar months.\n"
"- User analytics: Individual visitor data (including the anonymized IP address) in our analytics tooling will be deleted after 90 days.\n"
"\n"
"## Inspection, correction and deletion of data\n"
"Pursuant to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of access to your personal data upon request and, if necessary, to amend it or have it deleted. Please [contact us](/about/) in case you wish to do so. Because we keep your full IP address only temporarily in our server logs, you might need to supply us with additional information, such as about your device and browser as well as the date and time of your visit, for us to be able to honour your request.\n"
"\n"
"## Update privacy statement\n"
"We may change our privacy statement. We will announce this change on our website. Older versions of our privacy statement will be stored in our archive. Send us an email if you want to consult it."
