"\n"
"## What is Internet.nl?\n"
"Internet.nl helps you to check whether your internet is up to date. Do your [website](/test-site/), [email](/test-mail/) and [internet connection](/test-connection/) use **modern and reliable Internet Standards**? And if they don't, what can you do about it?\n"
"\n"
"## Who is behind Internet.nl?\n"
"The test tool Internet.nl is an initiative of the Dutch **Internet Standards Platform**. The aim of the platform is to jointly increase the use of modern Internet standards to make **the Internet more accessible, safer and more reliable for everyone**. The platform is a collaboration between parties from the Internet community and the Dutch government. The following parties are currently participating in the platform: \n"
"\n"
"- [Dutch Cloud Community](https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl)\n"
"- [Dutch Authority for Digital Infrastructure](https://rdi.nl/)\n"
"- [Dutch Standardisation Forum](https://forumstandaardisatie.nl/)\n"
"- [ECP](https://ecp.nl/)\n"
"- [Internet Society international](https://internetsociety.org/)\n"
"- [Internet Society Nederlands chapter](https://isoc.nl/)\n"
"- [Ministry of Economic Affairs and Climate Policy](https://www.government.nl/ministries/ministry-of-economic-affairs-and-climate-policy)\n"

"\n"
"ECP provides for the administrative home of the platform. The domain name Internet.nl is provided to the platform by the Netherlands chapter of the Internet Society. [Open Netlabs](https://opennetlabs.nl/) / NLnet Labs laid the foundation for Internet.nl and the underlying tooling. From 1 April 2021 onwards, maintenance and further development will be carried out by the project team of the Internet Standards Platform.\n"
"\n"
"## What are Internet Standards?\n"
"In order to exchange data between computers around the world, we need international agreements on how computers talk to one another. The digital \"plugs and sockets\" that link everything together, so to speak. These agreements are called Internet Standards or internet protocols. An example is SMTP, a well-known protocol for sending email. This technical core of the internet is invisible and unknown to most users. However it is crucial for a working internet today and in the future.\n"
"\n"
"## Why is it important to be up to date?\n"
"The original internet standards date from the 70s and 80s, when the number of internet users was small. Nowadays, there are more than three billion users worldwide! And these people use the internet more and more for transactions that are privacy-sensitive and costly. The old standards cannot meet this scale nor the modern safety requirements. For instance, criminals are abusing the SMTP standard to spoof the sender address of an email. This means that we have to start using new, smarter standards that keep our internet reliable. The good news is that these modern Internet Standards are available.\n"
"\n"
"## Are the Netherlands taking the lead in using modern Internet Standards?\n"
"Unfortunately, that is not the case. Even in a modern country like the Netherlands (that became the first internet connected European country in 1988) we use too many outdated standards that fall short of reliability. Not using these modern standards is a risk for the individual internet user, but also for the Dutch economy and for the world at large. Therefore, please help improving the internet and make sure that you use modern Internet Standards.\n"
"\n"
"## Who should act on modern Internet Standards?\n"
"Our access, hosting and email providers should take care of implementing modern internet standards and setting them correctly. Do the test results show any shortcomings? Then please send a message about this to your provider(s). If you use your own connection, webserver or mailserver, you have to take care of the correct settings yourself.\n"
"\n"
"## Why donâ€™t you address the access, hosting and email providers directly?\n"
"We do. Still it is important that internet users are aware themselves and send out signals to their provider(s) as well. This may come as a surprise, but in a modern country like the Netherlands we still use many standards that are outdated and lack reliability. Therefore please help us to improve the internet together, and demand modern Internet Standards."

"## Report accessibility audit\n"
"The website Internet.nl was audited for accessibility by the Dutch Accessibility Foundation at the end of 2018. The findings are included in the [report \"WCAG 2 study www.internet.nl - level AA\"](/static/accessibility/check_6967_auto_rapport.pdf) (in Dutch) d.d. 14 November 2018. Based on these findings, the Internet Standards Platform has implemented a number of improvements for the accessibility of Internet.nl.  "

"We also follow `include` and `redirect` for valid SPF records. In addition, we check that your SPF record does not exceed the allowed number of 10 DNS lookups making it ineffective. Each of the following SPF terms counts as a DNS lookup: `redirect`, `include`, `a`, `mx`, `ptr` and `exist`. While the SPF terms `all`, `ip4`, `ip6` and `exp` do not count as DNS lookups.\n"
"\n"
"Note that if the `include` or `redirect` domain consists of macros, we will not follow them as we do not have the necessary information from an actual mail or mail server connection to expand those macros. This means that we do not evaluate the outcome of macros. Moreover, we do not count DNS lookups caused by macros to determine whether the allowed number of DNS lookups has been exceeded.\n"
"\n"
"For sending domains, using `~all` (softfail) instead of `-all` (fail) is usually preferred. This is because when SPF authentication fails with an SPF fail, a receiving mail server may already block the connection without evaluating the DKIM signature and DMARC policy. This can lead to falsely blocked mails (e.g. when mails are automatically forwarded by the receiving mail server to another receiving mail server).

"\n"
"CSP guards a website against content injection attacks including cross-site scripting (XSS). By using CSP to configure an 'allowlist' with *sources of approved content*, you prevent browsers from loading malicious content of attackers.\n"
"\n"
"We test for the rules below that are based on good practices for a secure CSP configuration.\n"
"\n"
"1. The `default-src` directive should be defined and its value should be be either `'none'`,  or `'self'` and/or one or more URLs of the domain itself (including its subdomain or superdomain). This is to have a restrictive default fallback policy for source types that are used in your website for which no specific policy is defined. \n"
"Next to the mentioned values `'report-sample'` could be there in case you want code samples to be sent together with the 'violation reports'.\n"
"2. The `base-uri` directive should be defined and its value should be either `'none'`,  or `'self'` and/or one or more URLs of the domain itself (including its subdomain or superdomain). This restricts the `baseURI` in order to block the injection of a manipulated `<base>` element. This limits the ability of attackers to manipulate the locations of sources (e.g. scripts) that are loaded from relative URLs.\n"
"3. The `frame-src` directive should be used (either by definition or by relying on the fallback to sequentially `child-src` and `default-src`) and its value should be either `'none'`, or `'self'`and/or one or more specific URLs. This prevents content from unauthorized locations to be framed or embedded in your website (with HTML elements such as `<frame>` and `<iframe>`).\n"
"4. The `frame-ancestors` directive should be defined and its value should be either `'none'`, or `'self'` and/or one or more specific URLs. This prevents  unauthorized websites from framing or embedding your website (with HTML elements `<frame>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, or `<applet>`).\n"
"5. The `form-action` directive should be defined and its value should be either `'none'`, or `'self'` and/or one or more specific URLs. This restricts the URLs which can be used as the target of form submissions.\n"
"6. The source values `unsafe-eval`, `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-hashes` should *not* be used, because these enable XSS attacks. \n"
"7. The `data:` scheme should *not* be used in the `default-src`, `script-src` and `object-src` directives, because this enables XSS attacks.\n"
"8. When including a domain the `http://` scheme should *not* be used as a scheme, because this enables sources to be downloaded over an insecure connection. Use `https://` instead.\n"
"9. A wildcard (i.e. `*`) for the full host part of a URL should *not* be used in any directive, because this allows for any external source. Furthermore do *not* use just `https:` as this is equivalent to `https://*`. Always specify the main domain as well (e.g. `https://scripts.example.nl` or `https://*.example.nl`). \n"
"10. `127.0.0.1` should *not* be used in any directive, because it enables content injection attacks in a compromised system.\n"
"\n"
"Additional recommendations:\n"
"\n"
"1. Only use domains in CSP directives as specific as possible, which is tested automatically to some extent in this subtest for CSP.\n"
"\n"
"    * Do *not* allow all domains under a TLD (`*.nl`) or SLD (`*.gov.uk`), although we currently do *not* test for this. \n"
"    * Do *not* allow a different main domain under a SLD in `default-src` (for example `example2.gov.nl` for `example1.gov.nl`), although we currently do *not* test for this either.\n"
"\n"
"2. Ideally do *not* use inline scripts or styles. For cases where you cannot avoid using inline scripts or styles, do *not* use `unsafe-inline` (as mentioned above) but preferably use CSP hashes or otherwise CSP nonces.\n"
"3. Use the HTTP header as a mechanism for serving your CSP policy. Do *not* use the HTML `<meta>` element to serve your CSP policy. The latter is less secure and does not support all CSP directives (e.g. the required `frame-ancestors`). Therfore we do *not* check for CSP that is offered via the HTML `<meta>` element.\n"
"5. Use the HTTP header for `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` to experiment with your CSP configuration by monitoring its effect without enforcing it.\n"
"6. Note that an empty source list (i.e. a CSP directive without a value) is equivalent to a source list containing `none`. Besides, note that if other sources are listed in a source list next to `none`, then the attribute `none` is ignored. \n"

"- `Invalid`: The route announcement of the considered IP address is covered by a route authorisation, but it does *not* match. There are two possible causes: \n"
"\n"
"  1. the IP address block (Route Prefix) is announced from a provider network (Route Origin ASN) that is *not* authorised in the route authorisation (result in the table below: \"invalid (as)\");\n"

"\n"
"  Note: The status `Invalid` indicates an unintentional or malicious route configuration error, that can be caused by your hoster or its network provider (internal error) or by a third party (external error). In either case, it can lead to the unreachability of your server or the interception of Internet traffic to your server. Contact your hoster as soon as possible. In the case of an internal error, your hoster should ask his network provider that owns your server's IP addresses to fix the route configuration error. \n"

A HSTS policy change to revert effects will not have immediate effect for these browsers since they have cached your previous HSTS policy. \n"

"\n"
"1. Make sure that the website on your domain fully works over HTTPS now and in the future (e.g. by having a solid certificate rollover procedure);\n"
"2. Increase the HSTS cache validity period in the stages below. During each stage, carefully check for reachability issues and broken pages. Fix any issues that come up and then wait the full max-age of the stage before moving to the next stage. \n"
"\n"
"   - Start with 5 minutes (`max-age=300`);\n"
"   - Increase it to 1 week (`max-age=604800`);\n"
"   - Increase it to 1 month (`max-age=2592000`);\n"
"   - Increase it to 1 year (`max-age=31536000`) or more.\n"
"   \n"
" 3. Repeat step 1 and 2 for every single subdomain that you want to secure with HSTS. Only use `includeSubDomains` if you are fully sure that **all** the (nested) subdomains of your domain properly support HTTPS now and in the future.\n"
" 4. Do **not** use `preload` unless you are very, very sure that you want your domain to be included in the [HSTS Preload List](https://hstspreload.org/). We advise to only consider this if you run a high-profile website and if you know exactly what you are doing.\n"

Other network providers use these route announcements to determine via which route to send traffic for the IP addresses.\n"

"\n"
"Checking route announcements against route authorisations (RPKI Origin Validation; abbreviated: ROV) has the following three possible outcomes.\n"
"\n"
"- `Valid`: The route announcement of the considered IP address is matched by at least one published route authorisation. A route authorisation is also matched for more specific route announcements (i.e., for a part of the IP address block contained in the route authorisation), unless they are more specific than the limit specified in the route authorisation (via the `maxLength` attribute). \n"
"\n"
"- `Invalid`: The route announcement of the considered IP address is covered by a route authorisation, but it does *not* match. There are two possible causes: \n"
"\n"
"  1. the IP address block (Route Prefix) is announced from a provider network (Route Origin ASN) that is *not* authorised in the route authorisation (result in the table below: \"invalid (as)\");\n"
"  2. the IP address block (Route Prefix) that is announced is *smaller than is allowed* in the route authorisation, i.e. exceeding `maxLength` value (result in table below: \"invalid (length)\").\n"
"\n"
"  Note: The status `Invalid` indicates an unintentional or malicious route configuration error, that can be caused by your hoster or its network provider (internal error) or by a third party (external error). In either case, it can lead to the unreachability of your server or the interception of Internet traffic to your server. Contact your hoster as soon as possible. In the case of an internal error, your hoster should ask his network provider that owns your server's IP addresses to fix the route configuration error. \n"
"  \n"
"- `NotFound`: No statement with route-authorisation has been found that covers the route announcement of the considered IP address. This makes the routing of Internet traffic to your server less secure. Please contact your hoster about this. He can ask his network provider that owns your server's IP addresses to publish route authorisations.\n"

"you have been actively trying to find a vulnerability. In either case, please\n"
"let us know, so we can take action as soon as possible.\n"
"\n"
"By the way, this is **not** an invitation to extensively scan and test our\n"
"site for weaknesses. We are doing this ourselves.\n"
"\n"
"We would like to work with you to further improve the security of our website. We\n"
"will always take your reports seriously when it is compliant with our Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure policy \n"
"and will look into any suspected vulnerabilities.\n"
"\n"
"In our following policy on **Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure** we explain what we ask you and what we promise when you report a vulnerability to us.\n"
"\n"
"## We ask you to:\n"
"\n"
"- send your findings to us per [email](mailto:question@internet.nl) or via a [GitHub security advisory](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/security/advisories/new) as soon as possible;\n"
"- if sending an email, preferably encrypt your email with our PGP key;\n"
"- provide sufficient information to replicate the problem, so we can fix it as\n"
"  soon as possible; the IP address or the URL is generally sufficient, along with a\n"
"  description of the vulnerability, but for more complex vulnerabilities we\n"
"  may need more information;\n"
"- not run tests that attack via physical security, social engineering, or\n"
"  third-party applications;\n"
"- not run brute force or denial of service attacks;\n"
"- not exploit the vulnerability to, for example, change or delete data, or\n"
"  install malware;\n"
"- not share the problem with others until we have fixed it;\n"
"- not copy data from our systems, other than what is absolutely necessary\n"
"  to demonstrate the leak;\n"
"- leave your contact data (e-mail address and phone number), so we can get in\n"
"  touch and work with you to fix the problem.\n"
"\n"
"## We promise:\n"
"\n"
"- to respond to your notification within three working days, with an\n"
"  evaluation of your report and an expected date for a solution;\n"
"- to treat your report confidentially: we will not share your personal\n"
"  information without your consent, except to the police and the judiciary if\n"
"  a police report is made or if this information is legally required;\n"
"- to keep you informed of our progress in solving the problem;\n"
"- to include your name as the discoverer of the vulnerability in any news\n"
"  reports, if you wish;\n"
"- that an accidental discovery of a vulnerability will not lead to legal\n"
"  charges against you, as long as you play by the rules and act in the\n"
"  spirit of Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure;\n"
"- as a token of our gratitude, we will give you a t-shirt for each report of\n"
"  a security issue not yet known to us; we know this is not a big reward, but we do\n"
"  not want to stimulate active scanning for vulnerabilities.\n"
"\n"
"## Exclusions:\n"
"\n"
"Since our time is scarce, we ask you:\n"
"\n"
"* to **not** report trivial findings for which there are no known exploits and/or for which there is no real risk involved;\n"
"* to **not** blindly report findings from automated vulnerability scanning tools. Do not copy-paste the findings in an e-mail, but first take some time to understand the nature of our website before reporting anything;\n"
"* to realise that our tools are open source and available for reuse. We **cannot** be held responsible for implementations by others.\n"
"\n"
"Below are some examples of findings that you should **not** report. If you do, please realise that we do **not** reward these reports and we might **not** respond to your e-mail.\n"
"\n"
"- Vulnerabilities regarding domains other than internet.nl;\n"
"- Header information disclosures;\n"
"- SSRF vulnerability (this is not a vulnerability but intended functionality necessary for the proper functioning of Internet.nl);\n"
"- Publicly accessible files or folder with non-sensitive information (like robots.txt or images);\n"
"- Missing standards which are not promoted by Internet.nl (like MTA-STS);\n"

"### What norm is Internet.nl using?\n"
"Internet.nl checks the (correct) implementation of modern Internet Standards that improve the reliability of online services. A score of 100% means that a website, e-mail service or internet connection complies with our test norm. This norm is based on the Internet Standards on the 'comply-or-explain' list of the Dutch Standardisation Forum, on the security advices of the Dutch NCSC and on the relevant RFCs of IETF.\n"
"\n"
"### Will the norm be adjusted?\n"
"The test norm of Internet.nl will be adjusted over time as the state of the art changes. Adjustments will be announced through news items on our website. New subtests will (usually) not impact the score after their initial release and have the 'RECOMMENDED' or 'OPTIONAL' status. In the future these new items could get the 'REQUIRED' status and weigh in the overall score.\n"
"\n"
"### How does the score relate to security?\n"
"Although many of the tested Intern Standards contribute to a higher security level of your website, mail service or internet connection, a 100% score does not mean that an online service is fully secure. There are more aspects which are important for the security of your online services. But these are out of scope for Internet.nl. Please keep in mind that Internet.nl is intended as a standards compliance test and not as a security test.\n"
"\n"
"### How is the test report structured?\n"
"Internet.nl contains **three main tests**, i.e. for websites, mail services and internet connections. \n"
"These main tests consist of **test categories** that include **subtests**. For example, one of the main tests is the website test which contains a test category on HTTPS that has a subtest on HSTS.\n"
"\n"
"A subtest can have one of the following three requirement levels (in conformance with [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)):\n"
"  \n"
"- REQUIRED ('must')\n"
"- RECOMMENDED ('should')\n"
"- OPTIONAL ('may')\n"
"\n"
"When a subtest is either 'RECOMMENDED' or 'OPTIONAL', this is mentioned in the test explanation.\n"
"\n"
"### How is the percentage score calculated?\n"
"- Each main test is resulting in an overall percentage score.\n"
"- Every test category of a main test weighs more or less evenly in the overall percentage score. So if a main test consists of four test categories, the maximum score for every test category is 25%.\n"
"- Only the subtests with the status 'REQUIRED' weigh in the score of a test category and in the overall percentage score.\n"
"- Websites with a perfect score of 100% will be added to the [Hall of Fame](/halloffame/)."

"# Privacy statement\n"
"\n"
"*Revised 28th of March 2023*\n"
"\n"
"The Dutch Internet Standards Platform respects your privacy and strives to minimize the collection and processing of your personal data. With this privacy statement, we would like to inform you about what personal data we collect when you use our website and other services on Internet.nl and how we process this data. Your rights are covered by the applicable laws, mainly the [European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679) and the [Dutch Telecommunications Act](http://wetten.overheid.nl/BWBR0009950/).\n"
"\n"
"## What data will be collected?\n"
"\n"
"### Website (Internet.nl)\n"
"\n"
"#### Application\n"
"When you are using Internet.nl we collect the following data which is necessary for the functioning of the website.\n"
"\n"
"- IP address of your client (remote host) which made the request to our web server:\n"
"\n"
"\t- When a connection test is performed, only your *anonymized* IP address and *anonymized* reverse name are stored in the application database and shown in the connection test report that is available for the user via a permalink.\n"
"- In any other cases your (full or anonymized) IP address is *not* stored in the application database.\n"
"\n"
"- Domain names that you provided to perform email or website tests:\n"
"\n"
" \t- Domain names are stored in the application database. They will be shown in the test reports available for the user via a permalink and could be shown in the Hall of Fame.\n"
"\t- Only the domain name is stored, but *not* the 'local-part' (i.e. the part before @example.nl) of a provided email address.\n"
"\n"
"#### Server logs\n"
" For debugging connection issues and for solving (security) incidents we keep the below data in our web server logs.\n"
"\n"
"- IP address of the client (remote host) which made the request to our web server;\n"
"- The time that the request was received;\n"
"- User-Agent HTTP request header that your client browser reported about itself;\n"
"- Status code that the server sends back to your client;\n"
"- Size of the object returned to your client;\n"
"- Error message with regard to processing the request.\n"
"\n"
"#### User analytics\n"
"We put analytical cookies on your device to analyze the use of our website. We run Matomo (formerly Piwik) on our own web server. Matomo is one of the most privacy-friendly analytical tools currently available. The statistics generated with these cookies are used only to improve our website.\n"
"\n"
"We collect the following data:\n"
"\n"
"- IP address (anonymized);\n"
"- Very rough location of the user based on anonymized IP address; \n"
"- Date and time;\n"
"- Title of the page being viewed;\n"
"- URL of the page being viewed;\n"
"- URL of the page that was viewed prior to the current page;\n"
"- Screen resolution;\n"
"- Time in local timezone;\n"
"- Files that were clicked and downloaded;\n"
"- Link clicks to an outside domain;\n"
"- Pages generation time;\n"
"- Main Language of the browser;\n"
"- User Agent of the browser.\n"
"\n"
"Because the impact of these analytical cookies on your privacy is very limited in light of the GDPR and Section 11.7a of the Dutch Telecommunication Act, you do not need to give your consent for this. If you do not want us to track your device, we recommend that you turn on the *Do Not Track* function in your browser. Matomo will not track users that use the Do Not Track function (see [this page](https://matomo.org/docs/privacy/#step-4-respect-donottrack-preference) on Matomo.org). For more information about Do Not Track and how to turn it on in your browser, see the website [All About Do Not Track](https://allaboutdnt.com/).\n"
"\n"
"### Email (@internet.nl)\n"
"When you send emails to [question@internet.nl](mailto:question@internet.nl) we collect the following data: \n"
"\n"
"- Email address used and other mail header data (like time);\n"
"- Any other personal data that the sender put in the mail.\n"
"\n"
"## What third-party services are used?\n"
"\n"
"### WHOIS\n"
"In the website and email test, the registrar of the tested domain is queried via WHOIS. For this purpose, a query of the [IANA WHOIS Service](https://www.iana.org/whois) and of the WHOIS Service of the respective TLD registry (e.g. the [WHOIS Service of SIDN](https://www.sidn.nl/whois)) is done using the WHOIS protocol (plain text on TCP port 43).\n"
"\n"
"### Team Cymru\n"
"* In the RPKI test component of the website and email test, for each IP address found, the corresponding BGP Origin ASN is queried using Team Cymru's [\"IP to ASN Mapping Service\"](https://team-cymru.com/community-services/ip-asn-mapping/).\n"
"* In the connection test, for the IP addresses of your client and of your DNS provider, the ASN Description (for the purpose of naming the ISP and DNS provider) is queried using Team Cymru's [\"IP to ASN Mapping Service\"](https://team-cymru.com/community-services/ip-asn-mapping/).\n"
"\n"
"IP addresses are anonymized as much as possible prior to the query (for IPv4 on a /24, for IPv6 on a /48). The query takes place via DNS on UDP port 53. \n"
"\n"
"### Reverse DNS\n"
"In the connection test, the reverse name for the non-anonymized IP address of your client is queried (via [\"in-addr.arpa\" and \"ip6.arpa\"](https://www.iana.org/domains/arpa)) using our local DNS resolver. \n"
"\n"
"### Sentry\n"
"We use [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) to log crashes and similar bugs in tests and pages. For this, we may send Sentry the domain being tested, any information collected in the test, and the HTTP headers of the request. We do not include the IP address of your client in the information we send to Sentry. Information is only submitted on test or page crashes. No information is shared about performed tests or requested pages that do not result in crashes.\n"
"\n"
"## What measures are in place to secure the collected data?\n"
"\n"
"### Access and third parties\n"
"Our services are running on servers, that are maintained by Prolocation. ECP is in charge of operating the mailbox. Collected data and received information may be shared with other [members of the Internet Standards Platform](/about/) only to answer questions, to solve issues or to improve our services.\n"
"\n"
"Except for the services listed under \"What third-party services are used?\", no third party services are used (like external analytics tooling or web fonts). We do not in any way pass on personal data collected by us to third parties (i.e. outside the Internet Standards Platform), unless we are legally obliged to do so (for example, if the authorities with a legal basis request data from us).\n"
"\n"
"### Technical measures\n"
"We have implemented a.o. the following technical measures to secure your personal data:\n"
"\n"
"- Modern, secure standards are in place. We comply with our own tests. E.g. our web server offers an encrypted connection (HTTPS) and the domain is signed (DNSSEC);\n"
"- Software on our servers is updated regularly;\n"
"- Our engineers use strong authentication to access the servers.\n"
"\n"
"In case you find a vulnerability, despite of our efforts, please act in accordance with our [responsible disclosure](/disclosure/) policy.\n"

"### Anonymization\n"
"- Application: The anonymization of the IP address of your client means that at least the last 16 bits of each IPv4 address and the last 96 bits of each IPv6 address are discarded and replaced with zero's before storing in the application database (e.g. visible is only 198.51.0.0 or 2001:db8::). Besides we anonymize the found reverse name by masking the first one or more labels. By anonymizing the IP address and reverse name we make sure that it is usually nearly impossible to relate these directly to a person anymore, even not with the other associated data collected. \n"
"IP addresses belonging to web servers, mail servers or name servers will not be anonymized, because we consider this data to be public data which is published in DNS. The same goes for domain names; we also consider this to be public data. \n"
"- User analytics: At least 16 bits for IPv4 and 80 bits for IPv6 are discarded and replaced with zero's before storing an IP address in our analytics tooling (e.g. visible is only 198.51.0.0 or 2001:db81:85a3::).\n"
"\n"
"### Data retention period\n"
"- Application: Because the anonymized visiting IP address and associated collected data can not be directly related to a person, we do not maintain a specific retention period for the data stored in our application database.\n"
"- Server logs: Data collected in our server logs will be deleted after three calendar months.\n"
"- User analytics: Individual visitor data (including the anonymized IP address) in our analytics tooling will be deleted after 90 days.\n"
"- Email: Processing emails is a core activity of The Dutch Internet Standards Platform. Based on the [requirements](https://www.belastingdienst.nl/wps/wcm/connect/bldcontentnl/belastingdienst/zakelijk/ondernemen/administratie/administratie_opzetten/wat_hoort_er_allemaal_bij_uw_administratie) set by the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration, email correspondence will be deleted after seven years.  \n"
"\n"
"## Inspection, correction and deletion of data\n"
"Pursuant to the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), you have the right of access to your personal data upon request and, if necessary, to amend it or have it deleted. Please [contact us](/about/) in case you wish to do so. Because we keep your full IP address only temporarily in our server logs, you might need to supply us with additional information, such as about your device and browser as well as the date and time of your visit, for us to be able to honour your request.\n"
