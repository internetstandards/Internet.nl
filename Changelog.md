# Change Log

## 1.7

- Added specific [error messages in the technical details](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/577)
  for Content-Security-Policy results.
- Added requirements for [base-uri](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/525) and
  [form-action](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/524) to the Content-Security-Policy test.
- Added translations for [security.txt error messages](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/774).
- The TLS versions tech table
  [now shows the detected TLS versions](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/512)
  instead of only TLS versions with issues.
- Fixed an [uncaught exception](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/494)
  in the security.txt text which could cause the entire test to fail for some HTTP responses.
- Corrected handling of [bogus TLSA records](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/681).
- A bare "https:" is [no longer allowed in Content-Security-Policy](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/pull/925)
  as it matches any HTTPS host.
- [Loosened requirement for null MX](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/748)
  when a domain has no A or AAAA.
- Fixed an issue where the
  [frame-src test was inconsistent with the documentation](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/643).
- [Added the version number](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/494) to the footer.
- [Added Sentry support](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/770) for error reporting.
- Code quality was cleaned up in various places.
- Dependencies were updated.

This release has API version 2.3.0:
- The `record_org_domain` was added for DMARC
  ([#489](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/489)).
- The `securitytxt_errors` and `securitytxt_recommendations` types were changed.
  They now contain error codes (and possibly context) rather than full sentences.
- The `content_security_policy_errors` field was added with error codes for CSP.
- An issue was fixed where the `mx_nameservers` field was not included in results
  ([#882](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/882)).

## 1.6.3

- Fixed an issue in the HTTPS client code that caused DMARC records to not be detected, due to a missing
  public suffix list.

## 1.6.2

- Fixed issues in the example configs regarding [celery concurrency](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/817)
- Fixed an issue where test failures could cause [old test results to be displayed instead](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/pull/802)
- Added [celery task info to log messages](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/commit/d59ae723c095c2f1ef98b9c16e28bba02a9e49ff) to help debugging/tracing
- Small fixes to test explanation content

This release has API version 2.2.0, as there are no API changes.

## 1.6.1

- Fixed issues in the security.txt check for [invalid time formats](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/pull/800) and [empty responses](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/790)
- [Updated social media links](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/804)
- [Fixed an issue in the API and updated the version](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/pull/776)

This release has API version 2.2.0, a late update due to new fields added in 1.6.0.

## 1.6

- Add [security.txt support](https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/pull/730).
  For all IPs of web servers, this looks for the existence and validity of a
  [RFC9116](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9116.html) security.txt file.

This release has API version 2.1.0, which is incorrect as it does include new fields for security.txt. This was fixed in 1.6.1.

## 1.5.1

- Fixes a tiny typo in the RPKI news content.

This release has API version 2.1.0, as there are no API changes.

## 1.5.0

#### New

- RPKI support [(#613)]. For all IPs of all name servers, mail servers and web server, this check looks for the existence of an RPKI ROA, and whether all BGP routes covering these IPs are valid. As this is a new check, the total score does not yet include RPKI results.

#### Other changes

- Fixed issues with the IPv4/IPv6 consistency test for large pages [(#665)]
- Various dependencies updated [(#721)] [(#725)] [(#695)] [(#688)] [(#712)]
- Internal documentation improvements [(#717)]
- Small improvements in cache reset requests [(#724)]
- Small improvements in various test explanations.

Development & documentation
- Added installation steps to makefile for easier installation of the virtual environment and custom python dependencies

- Added a logger with dictconfig, this allows run time logging of the application
- Added (debug) log statements for further code inspection, especially on expiring tasks
- Separate scanning code from UI code via a new django app "checks"
- Added workaround / configs for Redis-backend-connection leak: https://github.com/internetstandards/Internet.nl/issues/676 on single scan mode. Cron settings and some bash scripts that restart the scan services every 6 hours. This allows tens of thousands of scans per recycle.
